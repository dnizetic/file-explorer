# file-explorer
File explorer / manager Lite for Android.

A simple, lightweight app for browsing your device's local file system.

Included operations:
- history / favorites creation, searching files, refreshing, cut / copy / paste, rename / delete, shortcut creation, file hiding, compressing files, home directory setting, file properties, multiple file copy / paste / etc.
The app is fully free. I created it for fun / learning purposes so I can't guarantee it has no bugs. I may be providing updates and bug fixes if requested.

A project started for a college course on Android development.

The application can be found on google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.landa.fileexplorermanager

Enjoy!
